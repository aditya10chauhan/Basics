/* Run time polymorphism - function overriding where functions get resolved at run time from VTABLE.
*
* C++ compiler creates VTABLE at compile time & inserts a pointer v_ptr that holds the address of
* VTABLE in every class that has virtual function or class that inherits from the class that has a
* virtual function. VTABLE is an array of function pointers pointing to virtual functions. If Derived
* class is missing implementation, its VTABLE contains pointer to the function, implemented in a
* Base class.
* Virtual desturctor is used to maintain the destructors call order in a polymorphic class in an 
* inheritance hierarchy.
*
*
* RTTI â€“ Run Time Type Information - allows the type of an object to be determined at run time.
*
* RTTI is included in VTABLE. Only for 
* POLYMORPHIC CLASS - has at least one virtual method;
* (ABSTRACT CLASS - has at least 1 pure virtual function, cannot be instantiated, but we can create pointer)
* RTTI is provided through two operators:
* dynamic_cast :	Used for type conversion of polymorphic types.
* typeid operator:  Used for identifying the exact type of an object.
*
*
* Upcasting   - converting a derived-class reference or pointer to a base-class reference or pointer,
*               it is always allowed for public inheritance without the need for an explicit type cast.
* Downcasting - is not allowed without an explicit type cast.
