# C++ Stack
In C++ Stack is a container adaptor. C++ Sequential Container Types:
<ul>
  <li>vector&emsp;fast random access; inserting/deleting other than at the back may be slow</li>
  <li>deque&emsp;fast random access; fast insert/delete at front or back</li>
  <li>list&emsp;only bidirectional sequential access; fast insert/delete at any point</li>
  <li>forward_list&emsp;access in one direction; fast insert/delete at any point</li>
  <li>array&emsp;fast random access; cannot add or remove elements</li>
  <li>string&emsp;fast random access; inserting/deleting other than at the back may be slow</li>
</ul>
The stack adaptor takes an existing sequential container type (other than array or forward_list) and makes it act like a stack.
