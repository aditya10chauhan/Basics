# Stack

LIFO - a restricted linear list (addition and deletion of data is restricted to the top).<br>
Basic operations:
<ul>
  <li>Push - insert data. If there is not enough room, result in overflow</li>
  <li>Pop - remove data. If stack is empty, result in underflow</li>
  <li>Top - read the top without deleting. If stack is empty, result in underflow</li>
</ul>
<br>
Stack operations are constant time operations.
